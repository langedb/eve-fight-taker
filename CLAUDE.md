## Architecture Overview

EVE Fight Taker is a Node.js/Express web application that analyzes EVE Online ship combat scenarios using multiple APIs and AI-powered analysis. The application has evolved from ESI-dependent to a fully static data-driven system with comprehensive all-V skill bonuses and detailed AI recommendations.

### Core Service Architecture

The application follows a service-oriented architecture with five main services initialized in `server.js`:

1. **ESIAuth** (`lib/esi-auth.js`) - Handles EVE Online SSO OAuth flow and ESI API interactions
2. **CacheManager** (`lib/cache-manager.js`) - Manages local disk-based caching with automatic hourly cleanup
3. **StaticData** (`lib/static-data.js`) - Loads and manages PyFA's EVE static data from JSON files for offline item lookup
4. **FitCalculator** (`lib/fit-calculator.js`) - Parses EFT format fits, calculates ship statistics with all-V skill bonuses (adapted from PyFA algorithms)
5. **AIAnalyzer** (`lib/ai-analyzer.js`) - Integrates with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for detailed combat analysis and tactical recommendations

### Current Application Flow

The application now implements a dual EFT input system:

1. **Your Ship**: EFT input field for user's fitted ship
2. **Target Ship**: EFT input field for enemy ship analysis
3. **Analysis Phase**: Detailed AI combat analysis with weapon-specific recommendations

### Environment Dependencies

Required environment variables in `.env`:
- `ESI_CLIENT_ID` / `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET` - EVE Developer application credentials (legacy, for future features)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google AI Studio API key for Gemini 2.5 Flash
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Express session encryption key

### Static Data Integration

The `StaticData` class (`lib/static-data.js`) provides offline EVE data access:
- **PyFA Data Source**: Uses PyFA's exported static data (types.*.json, groups.0.json, typedogma.*.json, dogmaattributes.0.json)
- **Item Lookup**: Fast name-based item searching without ESI dependency
- **Attribute Access**: Complete dogma attributes for damage, cycle times, and bonuses
- **Data Location**: `./staticdata/` directory with PyFA-compatible JSON files

### EFT Parsing Logic

The `FitCalculator` class implements comprehensive EFT format handling:

#### EFT Format Parsing (`parseEFT()` method):
- Header format: `[ShipType, FitName]`
- Section-based parsing (high/med/low/rig/subsystem slots, then drones/cargo/implants)
- Empty lines trigger section transitions
- Supports charged modules, offline modules, and quantity specifications
- **Static Data Integration**: All item lookups use local static data instead of ESI

#### ESI to EFT Format Conversion (`esiToEFT()` method):
- Converts ESI fitting data to standard EFT format following official EVE Developer specifications
- **String Flag Support**: Handles ESI string-based slot flags (`"LoSlot0"`, `"MedSlot4"`, `"HiSlot2"`, `"RigSlot0"`, etc.)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Also supports numeric flag values for legacy ESI sources
- **Proper Section Ordering**: Low → Medium → High → Rigs → Subsystems → Drones → Cargo
- **Correct Spacing**: Empty lines between sections with two empty lines between drones and cargo
- **Quantity Format**: Maintains proper ` x5` format for items with quantities

### Ship Statistics Calculation with All-V Skills

Statistics calculation now implements comprehensive skill bonuses based on actual EVE Online mechanics:

#### Verified Skill Bonus System (`FitSimulator.applyEffects()` method):
- **All Skills at Level 5**: Every skill assumed to be trained to maximum
- **Missile Skills** (verified bonuses only):

  - **Ballistic Control Systems**: 10% missile damage per module (stacking penalties apply)

#### Enhanced Damage Calculation:
- **Missile Damage**: Applied to ammunition damage with proper skill stacking
- **Drone Damage**: Applied via damage multiplier attribute with skill bonuses
- **Cycle Time Optimization**: ROF skills reduce weapon cycle times
- **Damage Type Breakdown**: Separate EM/Thermal/Kinetic/Explosive calculations with corrected attribute mapping
- **Accurate Damage Types**: Fixed attribute ID mapping (116=Explosive, 118=Thermal) for proper AI analysis
- **PyFA-Compatible**: Skill bonus application matches PyFA's calculation methods

#### Statistics Calculated:

### Advanced Range Analysis System

The application now features comprehensive range analysis capabilities for accurate tactical recommendations:

#### Enhanced Weapon Attributes (`lib/ai-analyzer.js`):
- **Turret Range Data**: Optimal range, falloff, and tracking speed extraction
- **Missile Range Calculation**: Flight time × velocity = maximum engagement range
- **EWAR Module Ranges**: Optimal range and falloff for neutralizers, scramblers, webs, jammers
- **Automatic Range Detection**: Identifies weapon types and extracts appropriate range attributes

- **Tracking Computer**: Identifies turret range enhancement potential
- **Range Rigs**: Recognizes passive range bonuses (Bay Loading Accelerator, Ionic Field Projector)
- **Signal Amplifiers**: Targeting range improvements
- **Script Analysis**: Analyzes available scripts in cargo for range vs precision optimization

#### Comprehensive Range Strategy Guidance:
The AI prompt now includes detailed range tactical analysis:

**Kiting Strategy** (when player has range advantage):
- Fight at optimal range but outside enemy weapon range
- Use speed/afterburner to maintain distance
- Optimal range calculation: Target's weapon range + 5-10km safety margin

**Brawling Strategy** (only when close-range advantage exists):
- Close distance quickly when short-range weapons outclass enemy
- Use tackle to prevent enemy escape
- Only recommended when player has superior close-range DPS/tank

**EWAR Range Limitations**:
- Energy Neutralizers: 6-10km range (small/medium/large)
- Warp Scramblers: 9-15km range
- Stasis Webs: 10-20km range
- ECM Jammers: 15-24km range
- **Critical Rule**: Never recommend EWAR at ranges exceeding module capability

**Mixed Range Strategy** (for ships with long-range weapons + short-range EWAR):
- Primary engagement at long range using weapons only
- Secondary close-range option if enemy approaches within EWAR range
- Example: "Fight at 40km with missiles; if they close to under 10km, activate neutralizers"

#### Range Calculation Examples:
- **Turrets**: Optimal + Falloff = effective range (50% damage at falloff edge)
- **Missiles**: Max Range = maximum engagement distance
- **Boosted Ranges**: Base range × (1 + module bonus) = effective range
- **Script Optimization**: Range scripts for kiting, precision scripts for application

#### AI Prompt Enhancements:
- **Range-Boosting Module Analysis**: Accounts for Missile Guidance Computers, Tracking Computers, and range rigs
- **Script Management**: Recommends range vs precision scripts based on engagement strategy
- **Specific Range Examples**: "25-30km to stay outside their 20km blaster range while using your 35km railgun optimal"
- **Module vs Drone Distinction**: Clear separation between ship modules and deployable drones

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend (`public/script.js`) maintains enhanced state management:

#### State Objects:
- `currentShipStats` and `currentShipFit` - Complete fit data for user's ship
- `targetShipStats` and `targetShipFit` - Complete fit data for target ship  
- Authentication status tracking (legacy)
- Analysis results with Markdown rendering

#### UI Components:

- **Analysis Results**: 
  - Win chance and time-to-kill metrics
  - Advantages/disadvantages lists
  - **Ammo Recommendations**: Specific ammo type suggestions with formatting
